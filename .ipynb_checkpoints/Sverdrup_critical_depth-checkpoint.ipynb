    "#### Sverdrup's critical depth \n",
    "\n",
    "A (fairly rough) version of Sverdrup's simple model of the critical depth. In a simple water column where the only (or main) processes are photosynthesis and respiration, Sverdrup and others proposed that there is a point where the rate of production by photosynthesis is matched by the rate of respiration, referred to as the conpensation depth. In order for a phytoplankton bloom at the surface, 'organic matter' production must exceed loss to microbiological respiration, so there should be a cross-over, or critical, depth, above which phytoplankton biomass can accumulate. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been a couple of interesting developments on this idea recently, and I thought it would be good to have a digital version and set of computations of the original idea. The have been a number of developments of the orginal idea, which doesn't for example consider grazers, the plot below is really just to give an intuitive interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most papers this old, finding the data was impossible, so this is done using data I pulled from the orginal figure with a plot digitiser. The paper can be found here https://tinyurl.com/ycl2nuxx."
